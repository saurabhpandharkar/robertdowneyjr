<p>
    Hollywood is a neighborhood in Los Angeles,
     California, most famous for its iconic film industry and studios.
      In 1886 when it was only an agricultural community, a real estate developer on his honeymoon,
       named H.J. Whitley, stood atop the hill in Hollywood looking over the valley. 
       A Chinese man hauling wood passed by and Whitley asked him what he was doing.
        When the man, because of his accent, replied, "holly-wood",
         Whitley was inspired to name the area Hollywood.
          Whitley's town grew and in 1903 it became a municipality.

<p>In the early 1900s filmmakers began to make movies in Los Angeles,
           and in 1910 Hollywood merged with Los Angeles. Its first studio opened in 1911.
            As the film industry grew Hollywood gained the nickname Tinseltown,
             and today it is known as the most famous film industry center in the world.

H. J. Whitley is known as the 'Father of Hollywood'. He was born in Canada and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the 1870s.

Before 1910 movie theatres had been banned in Hollywood. Things changed when Hollywood merged with Los Angeles in 1910.
